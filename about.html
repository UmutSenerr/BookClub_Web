        <p class="about-desc">  Hello! My name is Umut Åžener, and I am currently studying Software Engineering at Toros University, where I am honing my skills in programming, and technology.

I have created this book club page to bring book lovers together. Here, you can rate and review books, share your thoughts with others, and discover new recommendations tailored to your interests. In this way, my website helps people avoid wasting time on bad or unproductive books, making their reading experience more enjoyable and meaningful. </p>
